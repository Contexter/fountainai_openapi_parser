  title: FountainAI Ensemble Service
  description: This OpenAPI specification defines the endpoints for the FountainAI Ensemble Service, which acts as an intermediary between users, the OpenAI Assistant, and FountainAI services managed via Kong. All FountainAI services are routed and orchestrated through Kong API Gateway, providing centralized management and control. Kong's rerouting capabilities are leveraged to distribute user input dynamically across multiple services, enabling flexible interaction flows and the implementation of the mediator design pattern for efficient delegation and aggregation of responses.
